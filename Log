-stabalize boundary conditions

-explore, find how the different tunings shift the model.

-check CSV data "cleanliness",
if not force split,
add conditions for preprocessing.

-intialize conditions

-parameter tuning is required before removing the trajectory generator (1-21-26)

-random walk, use as a calibration tool early on. do not start tuning from random walk. (1-21-26)

-there are 7 known bifurcation events (1-23-26). which in essence means 14 different points of failure.

-Once the current version "Anneal"  is tuned, parameters will be set to zero across the board.  will release the model skeleton with all the additions. (1-23-26)
*once that skeleton is released there are notes within the code to ease tuning.
