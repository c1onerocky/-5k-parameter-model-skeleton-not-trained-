===================================
A lightweight probabilistic trajectory model.  Tracks low entropy motion paths through synthetic environments.

==================================
==============Main================
==================================

Minimal neural skeleton capable of representing complex trajectory divergence using, branch based latent representations. 
Designed for research, experimentation, and forward exploration.

====================================
=============Features===============
====================================

---------Ultra-lightweight----------
suitable for low resource, rapid iteration.

------Branching superposition-------
Multi branch latent trajectories allow modeling divergence and uncertainty without large attention mechanisms.

--------Low human bias-------------
Focused on probabilistic motion rather than human language or task specific outputs.

-------Residual consistency--------
residual layers ensure stable propagation of latent states.

-Complexified latent representation-Real + imaginary components allow uncertainty tracking and low-entropy pathing.

---------Time embeddings------------
Fourier features + linear projections encode continuous-time dynamics.

--------Readout to 3D space---------
Converts latent trajectories into observable 3D positions.

----------Installation--------------
(Windows + AMD GPU via ZLUDA)

Install Python >=3.10

Install PyTorch 
(CPU or CUDA via ZLUDA)

Bash
pip install torch torchvision
     (amd)
Add ZLUDA DLLs to your system PATH
